# Python-Hashing


This repository includes a python class which imports hashlib and a few others...

It serves the purpose of having fun while learning how hashes work. Enjoy! :)

Keep in mind if you don't have the rockyou.txt file (rockyou word list) you can download it or 
use a wordlist of your preference.
